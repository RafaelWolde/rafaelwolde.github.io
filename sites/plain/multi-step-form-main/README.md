## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```HTML
Learned how to use meta to control some default behaviors like auto-resize on input focus.
I learned common components like single selection lists, multiple selection lists, switches, checkbox, navigation, buttons
```

```css
I learned how to use font files in my frontend project. and learned how to use flex box properly. I also learned how box-sizing affects different properties and how to mitigate those effects.
```

```js
Organizing code for readability was my main focus on this project and I believe I have gained some hints how I could organize my code.
```

My main take on this project was that I have to plan how my html elements should be organized to account for both desktop and mobile before styling the elements only on the basis of either the desktop design or any other.

### Continued development

I want to master naming and organization of both javascript variables and css class names, Ids and more. and how to create an industry standard codebase.

### Useful resources

I have tried different approaches in this project though I keep forgetting to use them throughout.
Kavin Pawell is the person who recommended this site to me and he is most definitely helpful in gaining detailed knowledge on the subject of css.
I recommend his youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell and his posts on https://css-tricks.com/author/kevinpowell/ and anything on this site.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
